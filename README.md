# Match the Colour
Developed for my Project 1 at General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive, <b>Match The Colour</b> was inspired by a game I used to play with my students when I was teaching prior to my time in this course. Back then, I would use PowerPoint slides to display a colour word with a text colour that does not match the colour word. To earn the correct point, students will have to say out the colour of the word, instead of reading the word. For example, the word is "Pink" but it has blue as its font colour, thus, the correct answer is Blue.

## How to play

Objective of the game is to match the font colour of the random word in English Language to it's colour in Malay Language. The game also allows player to do vica versa in the next round. 10 points is awarded for every correct answer. Player is given 10 seconds to get as many correct answers within the time. At the end of the timer, player is able to choose if they would like to replay Round 1 or move one to Round 2.
